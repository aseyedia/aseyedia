My name is Arta Seyedian, and I am a [Bioinformatics Web Application Developer at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia](https://pedsnet.org/). Most of my career experience thus far has been in conducting data analyses in R and Python, but currently I have been something of a jack-of-all-trades, getting my hands dirty with pipelining in Docker and a customized [DSpace](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace) instance using Node.js, Angular, and TypeScript. I love using Obsidian and I am also pursuing a Master's of Computer Science at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.

I've also been working on a website lately. [Check it out!](https://www.artaseyedian.com)
