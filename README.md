## Hello

My name is Arta Seyedian, and I am a [Bioinformatics Data Engineer at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia](https://www.research.chop.edu/pedsnet). Most of my career experience thus far has been in conducting data analyses in R and Python, but currently I have been something of a jack-of-all-trades, getting my hands dirty with pipelining in Docker and building a customized [DSpace](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace) instance with Node.Js. I freaking love using Obsidian and I am also pursuing a Master's of Computer Science at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.

In my spare time, I have been working on building [my professional website. Check it out!](https://www.artaseyedian.com)
